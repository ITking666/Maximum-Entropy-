# Maximum-Entropy
This folder contains Matlab codes written by me to find Lagrangian multiplyers in order to find distribution maximizing entropy.
This code is not completed yet. I am working on it as I uploaded it.
This code is aimed to use mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis as constrains to find distribution.
